					<p>Starting in 2013, the State of Pennsylvania attempted to complete a modernization project for its unemployment compensation system. Last year, 42 months behind schedule and $60 million over budget, the project was finally canceled. All told, the failed IT project meant upwards of $350 million in wasted taxpayer dollars, not to mention incalculable damage to the financial wellness of the constituents who needed functioning IT to claim their unemployment compensation.</p>
					<p>The project did not do well getting off the ground. Early last year, Pennsylvania Auditor General Eugene DePasquale released a report detailing how poorly the project had been mishandled, giving it an “8.9 out of 10” for incompetency, decrying the failure to would-be beneficiaries saying "We found very high levels of incompetence here and wasted taxpayer money, services that should have been rendered to people that needed the benefits that weren't delivered, and employees that were left, basically, out in the cold.”</p>
					<p>Initially contracted out to IBM, the costs for the system modernization weren’t even supposed to be covered by the State of Pennsylvania, but by the federal government. Although there were a number of technical barriers in the project, the Auditor General’s report attributed the bulk of the delay to general mismanagement of the project. His report detailed poor adherence to technical requirements, poor code quality and testing, and overall ineffective governance and management of the project, specifically calling out the state-side management that had failed to fire IBM after years of ineffective service. Throughout the ordeal, three of the state’s eight unemployment centers were closed, and nearly 500 Labor and Industry employees lost their jobs due to budget constraints. These layoffs made it even more difficult to compensate for system malfunctions, and average wait times ballooned from 10 minutes to two hours with the bare workforce.</p>
					<p>These repeated failures finally came to a fever pitch in 2019, when the system crashed entirely, leaving PA officials scrambling to come up with backup methods for constituents to file their claims. The PA Department of Labor and Industry initially reached out on twitter to tell claimants to directly email in outstanding paperwork, but assured that payments would not run late due to the technical issues the Department was experiencing. The outage lasted four days in total, resulting in 2,500 people, virtually all of whom were necessarily living paycheck to paycheck by virtue of receiving the benefit, being told they would receive late unemployment checks. Even while acknowledging their situation, Governor Wolf noted that the state could not afford to compensate claimants for the lateness, and blamed the failure on the 50-year-old system. The Wolf administration eventually sued IBM in an attempt to reclaim any amount of lost funding from the project, purportedly to compensate claimants.</p>
					<p>The incident raised a number of conversations around the true cost of technology projects, the role of state management in privately-run contracts, and the mismatch between the causes and victims of digital disasters. </p>
